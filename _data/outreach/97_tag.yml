We are thrilled to have participated in the School for the Talented and Gifted Interim Term (TAG-IT) program. Collaborating with the <a href='http://vrsutd.org' target='_blank'>Virtual Reality Society</a>, we developed a workshop to introduce students to the world of Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality. Our workshop introduced students to Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, virtual reality development, Unity, and more. We enjoyed presenting to the bright students of TAG and thank the school for making this event possible!
