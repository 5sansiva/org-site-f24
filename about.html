        <p>Jeff Bezos, the current CEO of Amazon, stated in May of 2016 that society is on the cusp of entering the golden age of artificial intelligence. That, over the next two decades, human society and AI will become intertwined in a way that would seem like science fiction today. That modern AI tools, such as Alexa, IBM Watson, and Google TensorFlow, only scratch the surface of what's possible.</p>
        <p>A month after Mr. Bezos’ statement, the Artificial Intelligence Society (AIS) was born.</p>
        <p>In fact, our organization began under the general fascination of the impact that AI has <i>already</i> made on the world. Whether that be through Netflix’s movie recommendations or Facebook’s facial recognition software, it is incredible how ubiquitous AI has become in our daily lives. But as of today, many of the fascinating aspects of AI are largely unknown to the general public.</p>
        <p>We want to change that.</p>
        <p>From the nuts-and-bolts of AI, such as Bayesian logic in Markov assumptions, to the bigger picture, like how AlphaGo works on a general level, the AIS hopes to demystify this field. That is why we have placed educational outreach as one of our main priorities, with the goal of inspiring others to learn more about AI past the resources our organization provides. Regardless of age, occupation, or major, we believe that a simple appreciation of artificial intelligence will become necessary as this technology advances.</p>
        <p>We understand that much of what's been discussed here seems complex and maybe even intimidating. However, if you stick with us throughout your time at UT Dallas, we promise to replace your fear with passion, and the complexity with simplicity.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the future.</p>
