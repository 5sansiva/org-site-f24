description: To follow up after our school visits below, we will be launching a month-long program at UTD starting in February 
             for high school students to learn more about AI. The program will consist of four workshops that cover concepts such as 
             neural networks, image recognition, genetic algorithms, and natural language processing. After those workshops,
             the program will end with a mini-hackathon for students to showcase their creativity and skills with the
             help of mentors.
