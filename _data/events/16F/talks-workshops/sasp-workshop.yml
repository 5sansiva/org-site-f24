ASP allows simulation of reasoning techniques that humans employ on a daily basis---default reasoning, counterfactual reasoning, abductive reasoning, etc. Thus, very powerful reasoning applications can be built with ASP such as&#58 web-based recommendation systems, undergraduate degree audit and advising, disease management, representing high school biology knowledge, etc. The s(ASP) system is an implementation of ASP developed at UT Dallas.</br></br>Sample s(ASP) applications&#58</br></br>1.
