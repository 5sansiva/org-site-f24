description: Our mission in the AIS is to raise awareness of AI and its potential to UTD and the surrounding communities. Throughout
             January, we will be doing just that by visiting high schools in the Dallas area. Currently, our list includes the Science/
             Engineering Magnet, Independence, and McKinney Boyd high schools. We're incredibly excited to make an impact on these students!
