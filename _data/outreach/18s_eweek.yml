description: "How do you know if a machine is intelligent? If you were chatting with an unknown person on the computer, could you tell if you are speaking with a real human, or a chatbot? At The University of Texas at Dallas <a href='https://engineering.utdallas.edu/engage/events/2018-national-engineers-week/' target='_blank'>2018 National Engineers Week</a>, we provided the opportunity for participants to experience the Turing Test. This is an experiment in which a participant chats with two anonymous  people (one human and one chatbot), and the goal for the participant is to identify which person is the chatbot.</br></br>Thanks everyone for visiting our booth!
